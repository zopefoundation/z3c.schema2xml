* Deserialized values for Choice fields that have associated sources
  (vocabularies) should be checked against their respective source.

* Values for Choice fields should be taken from the associated source, where
  the text of the XML element for this choice represents the value's token.

* Whenenever the XML element is empty, the value of the object should
  not be None but the default object that the schema indicates.

* What to do when importing something that has no XML but is required
  according to the schema. Error?

* Add an option to serialization that does not generate XML element if the
  content of the object is equal to the schema default.

* test adapter lookup failure

* test whether GeneratedObject implements right schema interface.

* test without explicit __name__ for Lists. What should happen? Fallback
  on interface name?

* test deserialization on an empty object.

* what to do in case of a missing element in an XML document?

* form data file instances need to provide schema

Punt

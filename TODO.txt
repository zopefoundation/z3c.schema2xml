* Merge z3c.schema2json and z3c.schema2xml into one. Maybe by using
  named adapters for I[Something]Generator interfaces, where the name
  could specify the input/output mode?

* Whenenever the XML element is empty, the value of the object should
  not be None but the default object that the schema indicates.

* What to do when importing something that has no XML but is required
  according to the schema. Error?

* Add an option to serialization that does not generate XML element if the
  content of the object is equal to the schema default.

* Test adapter lookup failure.

* Test whether GeneratedObject implements right schema interface.

* Test without explicit __name__ for Lists. What should happen? Fallback
  on interface name?

* Test deserialization on an empty object.

* What to do in case of a missing element in an XML document?

* Form data file instances need to provide schema.

* Custom factories instead of GeneratedObject.

* What to do with XML namespaces?
